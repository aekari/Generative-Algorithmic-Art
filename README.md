## Description

This is a [generative/algorithmic](https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Generative_art) assignment completed for the 1st and 2nd weeks of [Programming for Artists](https://iq2prod1.smartcatalogiq.com/en/Catalogs/City-College-of-New-York/2017-2018/Undergraduate-Bulletin/Courses/ART-Art-Course-Descriptions/30000/ART-39552). I chose to use [William J. Kolomyjec's piece 'Birds'](https://www.atariarchives.org/artist/sec15.php) as inspiration.
<br><br>
My goals were to:
- Create a Processing sketch that incorporates a change in color based on mouse input and
- Include an element of randomness that is triggered with user input

## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Install [Processing](https://processing.org)
2. Download this repository to your local computer
3. Open the .pde file in Processing and run the sketch
4. Click the canvas
