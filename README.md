# Artist and Computer Re-Creation
This is a homework assignment for the 1st and 2nd weeks of Programming for Artists. I chose to use [William J. Kolomyjec's piece 'Birds](https://www.atariarchives.org/artist/sec15.php) as inspiration.

#### My goals were to:
- Create a Processing 5 sketch that incorporates a change in color based on mouse input and
- Include a random element that changes with user input.
#### Resources:
I used [The Coding Train on Youtube ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) & [Processing 5's Reference page](https://processing.org/reference/).
